Subreddit Word Bot
==================

A simple python bot that goes through comments from a subreddit (top-alltime posts), collects data on how frequently words are used and writes the data to a CSV file.

### Usage:

    > python srwb.py [username] [subreddit] [# of posts]

* `[username]`   - Your Reddit username
* `[subreddit]`  - The subreddit you wish to gather data from
* `[# of posts]` - How many posts to analyze
